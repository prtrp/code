how program:
  -think more methodically, 
  -braking down big problem in small ones, Decomposition, see the big pictures.
  -thinking algorithmically.

stringToCamel:

1. iterate the array untill arr[i] != \0;
2. controll if arr[i] != - or _
3. if arr[i] is == - or _ upper case next character
4. eliminate _ or - and diminuate to 1 the index of next character.
